! dronePath specifies a path where the drone executable may
! be found.  This is used by the master process when executing
! remote drones via rsh.  The full path name is needed since
! the drone executable will probably not be found in rsh's
! PATH.
Chaos*dronePath: /usr/local/bin/X11/drone

! mapDir specifies the pathname where colormap specification
! files are stored.  These files have the extension ".map"
! and are plain ASCII files consisting of red-green-blue 
! triplets one to a line with values in the range 0-255.
! New maps may be created by hand or with the help of the
! gencmap utility.  This path should probably be changed
! to some directory under the users home directory.
! Currently it is set to work if chaos is executed from
! chaos/master.
Chaos*mapDir: ../maps

! imageDir specifies the pathname where images are to be
! saved to and loaded from.  Images have filenames with
! the extension ".cif" (chaos image format).  This format is
! is an extension of the X window dump format which means
! that chaos image format files may be loaded with xwud or
! processed with any other conversion utility which recognizes
! X window dump formatted images.  This path should be changed
! to where the user wishes to store these images.
Chaos*imageDir: .

! zoomDir specifies the pathname where the images of the zoom
! stack are to be stored.  Zoom images have filenames of the
! form "LEVEL##.cif".  This path should be changed to a 
! directory where there is sufficient disk space to hold a
! number of potentially large files.  The directory /tmp 
! might be a good choice since this directory will be
! periodically cleared of any old images.
Chaos*zoomDir: .

! taskWidth and taskHeight are the width and height of the
! tasks that the drawing region is divided into for 
! computation by drone processes.
Chaos*taskWidth: 32
Chaos*taskHeight: 32

! keepTasksSquare is a boolean value which determines if the
! tasks should be forced to be square.  If the value is True,
! taskWidth and taskHeight are set to their average and are
! constrained to remain equal.  If the value is False, the
! values may vary independently.
Chaos*keepTasksSquare: True

! retainAspectRatio is a boolean value which determines if the
! aspect ratio will be preserved while zooming.  If the value is
! True, the zoom will occur around the center of the zoom
! rectangle while preserving the same aspect ratio.  If the
! value is False, the zoom will occur within the limits of the
! zoom rectangle and the aspect ratio will be distorted.
Chaos*retainAspectRatio: True

! iterationLimit specifies the maximum number of iterations
! before a point will be considered to be within the Mandelbrot 
! set (and colored black).
Chaos*iterationLimit: 256

! hosts is a list of hostnames of machines which are available
! to run one or more drone processes.  This resource should be
! tailored to each site's environment.
Chaos*hosts: calvin hobbes
